        Welcome back to a fresh new edition of Brainhack Donostia!

        From the BrainHack organizing team we are happy to present Brainhack Donostia 2021. A gender-balanced board of researchers from BCBL invites you to join a three-day online workshop focused on project development to foster new ideas, findings and future collaborations. In addition, we will host four international keynote speakers that will share their experience on state of the art methods, good practices in science and hot topics in research nowadays. By doing so, we will continue to grow our contributions towards sharing knowledge openly and transparently across disciplines and specialties, and to the development of open-source tools.
