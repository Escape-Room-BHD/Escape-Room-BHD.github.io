**Got a project idea? Submit! Project submissions for Brainhack Donostia 2021 are now OPEN!** 

**[Contact us](https://brainhack-donostia.github.io/contact/) if you are not sure about your project being eligible, or don't know how to fill in the submission form.**

<center style="padding-bottom: 1em;"><a class="submission-button" href="https://forms.gle/cUcY4BB5sNjg1TuEA" target="_blank">Submit</a></center>

## Key points

We want to encourage participants to join the event with their mindset ready to collaborate on projects and hope it will also lead to a better chance of collaborating and networking. At the same time, we hope it will help project leaders get collaborators too.

Activities carried out during Brainhack Donostia 2021 can result in useful outputs for the neuroscience community. **We highly encourage you to submit a project for this year's edition.** If you are in need of inspiration, have a look at the project ideas we have received so far, or check out the projects submitted to <a href="https://brainhack.org/global2020/projects" target="_blank">Brainhack Global</a> last year.

### For attendees:

- **Attendees are required to commit to a project for the duration of Brainhack Donostia 2021.**
- Attendees can work on any of the projects on the <a href="https://brainhack.org/global2021/projects" target="_blank">Brainhack Global website</a>.
- Attendees will receive an email days before the event to select the project they will work on.
- Projects are the perfect chance for active collaboration, networking and hands-on learning, both during and after the event.

### For project leaders:

- Projects can focus on _any technique or method_, use behavioral or neuroimaging data, or explore any topic related to Open Science.
- Projects can involve _any stage of the scientific process_, from data acquisition to analysis and documentation, as well as data visualization and scientific publication.
- Projects can also be focused on _creating tutorials or improving the documentation_ of a library/program, or even replicating a paper (and dockerize it!).

  <h4 style="font-size: 1.8em">Aroma</h4>
  <p style="padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">ICA-AROMA (i.e. ‘ICA-based Automatic Removal Of Motion Artifacts’) concerns a data-driven method to identify and remove motion-related independent components from fMRI data. To that end it exploits a small, but robust set of theoretically motivated features, preventing the need for classifier re-training and therefore providing direct and easy applicability. The aim of this project is to modify the original ICA-AROMA code in order to restructure it into a pure Python package; e.g., dropping FSL calls in favor of pure Python functions.</p>

  <h4 style="font-size: 1.8em">abstract2poster</h4>
  <p style="padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">Do you need your poster ready to print/upload in two hours? Abstract is ready but you cannot bother to read it anymore? 
Imagine you could automatize the abstract->poster transformation, and then just tweak a few minor things to make it shine and impress everyone in that conference! 
In the abstract2poster project we will work towards developping a pipeline to translate your abstract to a ready-to-present poster. How? We are planning to use `Jekyll` but other ideas are welcome!</p>

  <h4 style="font-size: 1.8em">Automatic plosive detection and VOT extraction using the Plosion index</h4>
  <p style="padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">Do you wish you didn't have to spend hours manually combing through your audio data to identify plosives and extract their voice onset times (VOT)? Introducing the Plosion Index! The Plosion index is a measurement from the speech recognition literature (Ananthapadmanabha, Prathosh, & Ramakrishnan; 2014) to facilitate the detection of plosives in natural language data. It is based on an algorithm that calculate at each time point the ratio between the instantaneous amplitude of an acoustic signal and the mean amplitude of the signal during the preceding few milliseconds. It is designed to detect brutal changes in amplitude typically linked to the puff of air expulsed out of the mouth during the release phase of a plosive. This mean that the Plosive index is not only able to detect plosives in speech data, but also to determine the exact moment of the plosive release, making it possible to automatize the calculation of VOT, that is the interval of time between the release of the plosive and the moment when the vocal chords start to vibrate to produce the following vowel.</p>

  <h4 style="font-size: 1.8em">Universal data load for neural networks</h4>
  <p style="padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">There exit data loader pipeline for deep neural network project using Tensorflow or Pytorch, but they mainly focus on computer visions and natural language processing. When neuroscientists implement deep neural network models on neuroimaging or neurosignal data, a customized pipeline must be written from scratch every time. This project aims to provide a universal data loader, based on either Tensorflow or Pytorch data loader pipelines, so that it is easier for neurosientists to implement neural network modeling in the next steps. </p>
