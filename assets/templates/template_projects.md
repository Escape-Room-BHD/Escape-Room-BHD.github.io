## Key points

We want to encourage participants to join the event with their mindset ready to collaborate on projects and hope it will also lead to a better chance of collaborating and networking. At the same time, we hope it will help project leaders get collaborators too.

Activities carried out during Brainhack Donostia 2021 can result in useful outputs for the neuroscience community. **We highly encourage you to submit a project for this year's edition.** If you are in need of inspiration, have a look at the project ideas we have received so far, or check out the projects submitted to <a href="https://brainhack.org/global2020/projects" target="_blank">Brainhack Global</a> last year.
