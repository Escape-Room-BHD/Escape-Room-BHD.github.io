### There’s a bit more about Cass’ talk in Brainhack Donostia in her abstract below!

In this talk I will lay the groundwork for what inclusivity is, and why good open and reproducible research should be designed with inclusivity in mind. I will invite you to think about the impact of poor inclusivity practices on individual researchers who are attempting to engage with your work, as well as specific impacts on traditionally excluded groups. We will close with a discussion about what we can do as individuals to improve the inclusivity in our own projects and shared resources, and efforts we can be supporting as a community of open researchers.
