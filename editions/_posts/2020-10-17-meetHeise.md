Meet Verena Heise, one of our confirmed speakers in Brainhack Donostia Online Edition! Being an advocate of Open Science, she will be presenting on how to deal with research findings in a more widely accessible and involved way. She will share her experience and the various practices she has been also carrying out in her own research to achieve these goals.

### A bit about Dr Heise

Dr Heise holds a Research Fellowship at Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg, an Institute for Advanced Study in Delmenhorst, Germany. She is a molecular biologist, neuroscientist, and epidemiologist by training with degrees from the University of Heidelberg, Germany, and the University of Oxford, UK. In her research at Oxford, she combined genetic and neuroimaging data to investigate biological mechanisms underlying human brain ageing and neurodegeneration. Her current research focuses on meta-research to investigate how Open Science practices improve reliability of research findings in biomedical sciences, in particular in neuroimaging and Alzheimer’s disease research.
In addition to her research, Dr Heise is very passionate about reducing research waste through promoting transparency, better research practices, education, and changing incentives. She is involved in several initiatives to stimulate a much-needed cultural change in research.You can find out more about Dr Heiseon at [vheise.com](https://vheise.com/)

### There’s a bit more about Verena’s talk in Brainhack Donostia in her abstract below

Are most published research findings false? Why should we care? And is there anything we can do about it? In this talk I will give an overview of some practical solutions such as open science and good research practices in neuroimaging that can help make our research findings more robust. While there are a number of solutions that can be implemented by individual researchers, there are wider issues, for example around skills training and incentives, that require cultural change. To lobby for this change I am involved in a number of different initiatives and I will briefly outline current and planned activities.
